# kallax

kallax is a music library web app that utilizes the Discogs API to allow you to compile and view a virtual collection of music using the most thorough music database out there. it is built on the MEVN stack (mongodb, express, vue, and node js).
 
the app arose as a response to frustrations from the lack of (especially older techno/dance records) on spotify and other commercial streaming services, and an attempt to combine the unparalleled breadth of music on Discogs and YouTube into a single, clean interface.
 
this repository hosts the front end of kallax.
